There are a lot of javascript tools that can be used to get the same output. So I find it fascinating to learn different methods and different techniques that can be used, such as the switch statement. 

The hardest thing for me was knowing where to start. It took time to figure out that I just need to break things down. I can say that writing things out in pseudocode from the beginning would have made all of this much easier. In addition to that, when it came to the end and I thought I was done, I realized that some things have been forgotten about. Such as when I accidnetly hit cancel on the password length and it when through all the other prompts so I had to come up with a solution to fix that.
